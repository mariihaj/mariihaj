## Hello! I'm Maria
I'm a **Mechatronics Engineering student** passionate about **3D design** and **robotics** 🤖.  

In my free time, I enjoy learning:  
- 🛠 **Arduino**: tinkering with electronics and building cool projects  
- 🖊 **AutoCAD**: designing 3D models and mechanical parts  

When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me exploring new tech, robotics challenges, or just experimenting with new ideas 💡.
